# Additional Observations
observations:
  unexpected_behaviors: grafana web interface did not match described steps; promQL queries returned no results on first attempt
  suggested_improvements: add a revision date to the walk through to indicate when these instructions were "last known good" and  ensure all revision data is current for the project period by testing them before the project is announced.
